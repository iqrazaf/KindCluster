## Interference Graphs for Scenario(S1) under study
The resulting STIG set is stored as multiple serialized NetworkX graphs (*.gpickle) under the stigs_graphs/ folder. 
The files follow a consistent naming scheme such as:
STIK_worker1_product-page_web-ui_<k>.gpickle, where <k> is the snapshot index (e.g., 0, 1, 2, …).
Here, worker1 indicates the cluster-node context under which the STIG snapshot was produced, and the product-page_web-ui portion encodes  the selected source–target pair for this case-study.

Note on naming: the prefix STIK in filenames refers to the same artifact as STIGs in the paper (Spatio-Temporal Interference Graphs). It is a naming variation in the implementation, not a different model.
