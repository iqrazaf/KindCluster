## Terminology note: STIGs vs STIK

You will see both **STIGs** and **STIK** in the code and folder names (for example, `STIK_DIR`).  
They refer to the **same concept**: **Spatio-Temporal-Interference-Graphs (STIGs)**.  
“STIK” is just a naming variation in the implementation, not a different method.
